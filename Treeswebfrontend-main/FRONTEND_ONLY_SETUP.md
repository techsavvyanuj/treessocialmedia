# Frontend-Only Application Setup Guide

## Overview
This application has been completely converted to run as a frontend-only application using demo data. All backend dependencies and database connections have been removed.

## What Was Removed
- ✅ Backend directory (`/backend`)
- ✅ Database models and schemas
- ✅ API service files (`src/services/api.ts`)
- ✅ Backend-related documentation
- ✅ Supabase dependency
- ✅ All database credentials and environment variables

## What Remains (Frontend Only)
- ✅ React components with full functionality
- ✅ Demo data service (`src/services/demoData.ts`)
- ✅ Demo configuration (`src/services/demoConfig.ts`)
- ✅ All UI components and pages
- ✅ Authentication system (demo-based)
- ✅ Chat functionality (demo-based)
- ✅ Matching system (demo-based)
- ✅ Subscription management (demo-based)
- ✅ Admin panel (demo-based)
- ✅ Settings and preferences (demo-based)

## Demo Credentials
Use these credentials to test the application:

### Regular User
- **Email/Username**: `demo@example.com`
- **Password**: `demo123`

### Admin User
- **Email/Username**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### Premium User
- **Email/Username**: `premium@example.com`
- **Password**: `premium123`

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Vercel Deployment
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy - no environment variables needed!

## Features Available
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Login/Register with demo accounts
- 👥 **User Profiles**: View and edit profile information
- 💬 **Chat System**: Send messages between users
- 🎯 **Matching**: Swipe and match with other users
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- 📊 **Admin Panel**: Manage users, content, and analytics
- ⚙️ **Settings**: Customize preferences and privacy
- 🔔 **Notifications**: Real-time notification system
- 💳 **Subscriptions**: Manage premium features

## Demo Data
All data is generated locally and includes:
- 50+ demo users with realistic profiles
- Sample posts, messages, and matches
- Subscription tiers and payment history
- Admin logs and analytics data
- Chat conversations and notifications

## Switching Back to Real API
If you want to restore backend functionality later:
1. Restore the `backend/` directory
2. Restore `src/services/api.ts`
3. Update all hooks to use real API instead of demo data
4. Add environment variables for database connection
5. Install backend dependencies

## File Structure
```

├── components/          # All UI components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks (using demo data)
├── services/           # Demo data and configuration

├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── pages/              # Page components
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Build Errors**: Run `npm run build` to check for issues
- **Demo Data Issues**: Check `src/services/demoConfig.ts` for configuration
- **UI Problems**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

## Performance
- No network requests to external APIs
- Fast loading with local demo data
- Optimized bundle size for Vercel deployment
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
